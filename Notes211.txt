get a fuckin notebook to take notes

structures - classes, repositories, methods, properties

classes vs switch (ease for code, wont know ahead of time until debug)
 -class, list scores, dictionary. setting scope of classes, one attribute at a time
 -set what you know first, pacman ex. know 5000 pts, 3 lives, within player class


now on, make git repos for each solution, else errors when deployed

Class project
|-> (Classes properties)
|-> (Repo methods)

Unit test / console, start anywhere
Console (play, run etc)
|--> Program (Main)
|--> ProgramUI Run, hit run, only see menu ex 
	|-->run(menu)

properties --> methods
